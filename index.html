      <p class="para">I know at this point you are not in the
          mood to read any long unexaminable texts
          and so I will go streight to the point.(You will learn
          more about the purpose of this website later).</p>
      <p class="para">We met the pasco coordinator for MB3 and he
          highlighted a lot of very important stuff we should
          take note of. Fortunately he also gave us the full
          pasco for their IAs(233, 235, 237) and other
          compiled questions relevant for our IA. According to him,
          they will sure come,
          and those who refuse to go through them for
          whatever reasons will get the shock of their lives
          when they sit on the paper and realise they have
          been focusing on the wrong stuff in their studies.</p>
      <p class="para">Know that I have sacrificed a lot of time in
          putting this together, And that is because of how
          important it is, if you are unable to go through
          any materials at all, make sure you find time to
          go through the ones here.</p>
      <p class="para">As a member of the Aca Board, I promise you that
          the Aca Board is working tirelessly to ensure that
          NO ONE is left behind this year(God willing).</p>
